Dear Diary,

It's 5:30 in the morning, and I am still awake.

Let this be a reminder that I shall never wait until the day before proposal's due to start scraping.

No matter how easy the scraping part seems.

Oh yes, and this project is about MTA's lost and found system.

**data**:

**mistakes**:
1) wait until the last day
2) spending too much time on trying to read xml -- for some reason I orginally wanted to transform it into `.json`
