Donna Moss: What's take out the trash day?

Josh Lyman: Friday.

Donna Moss: I mean, what is it?

Josh Lyman: Any stories we have to give the press that we're not wild about, we give all in a lump on Friday.

Donna Moss: Why do you do it in a lump?

Josh Lyman: Instead of one at a time?

Donna Moss: I'd think you'd want to spread them out.

Josh Lyman: They've got X column inches to fill, right? They're going to fill them no matter what.

Donna Moss: Yes.

Donna Moss: So if we give them one story, that story's X column inches.

Josh Lyman: And if we give them five stories...

Josh Lyman: They're a fifth the size.

Donna Moss: Why do you do it on Friday?

Josh Lyman: Because no one reads the paper on Saturday.

Donna Moss: You guys are real populists, aren't you?
