This project is on NYC's LEP population, otherwise known as Limited English Proficiency, you know, people who doesn't speak English that well.

I intent to use this project to add onto a reporting assignment I'm doing. The assignment is about court interpreter -- court-appointed translators who help LEP group to navigate the court system.

For the first draft, I got census data and shapefile from www.census.gov, then threw them into QGIS. There's little coding involved so far, still, I'll upload everything I got here.
